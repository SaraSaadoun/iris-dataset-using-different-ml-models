# iris-dataset-using-different-ml-models
This repository explores the Iris dataset using various machine learning models, including supervised (classification) and  unsupervised (clustering) tasks.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains features such as "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm", "PetalLengthCm", "PetalWidthCm," and the target variable "Species." The goal of the supervised task is to train and evaluate different machine-learning models on the Iris dataset.

# Supervised Task
## Task Description
 - provide insights into model training, evaluation, and performance comparison among  3 different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).
<hr>
# Unsupervised Task
This task focuses on determining the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset using unsupervised machine-learning techniques.

## Task Description
The objective of Task 2 is to identify the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset and visualize the results. This task is part of the Sparks Foundation Internship program in Data Science and Business Analytics.

# Notebook
- using unsupervised learning techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset. The notebook includes visualizations to showcase the clustering results.
