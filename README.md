# iris-dataset-using-different-ml-models
This repository explores the Iris dataset using machine learning models, including supervised (classification) and  unsupervised (clustering) tasks.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains features such as "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm", "PetalLengthCm", "PetalWidthCm," and the target variable "Species."

# Supervised Task
 - provide insights into model training, evaluation, and performance comparison among 3 models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).
<hr>

# Unsupervised Task
- using unsupervised learning techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters for the Iris dataset. The notebook includes visualizations to showcase the clustering results.
